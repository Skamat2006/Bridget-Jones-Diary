# Bridget-Jones-Diary
Do you love the sound of your own voice? Do you feel that you have something to share that you don't want anyone else to see?

This is your chance to write about your wildest dreams, deepest fears and regrettable choices. We want you to build your own version of the Bridget Jones's Diary!

The goal of this hackathon is to build a Personal Diary app using all the concepts you have learned so far:

- Backend development (Javascript, Express/API)
- Front-end development (HTML and CSS)
- Databases (SQL)
- MVC structure
- UX methodologies
Your appâ€™s purpose is to manage and keep track of diary entries. A user should be able to see, create, update and delete diary entries.

Your application will need to have a backend, a frontend and a database:

- For the backend, use Express and JavaScript
- For the frontend, use HTML and CSS
- You can manage your database with SQL
- You can use Docker for your database, or an external host if you would prefer (e.g Supabase)

**User stories**
As a user, I should be able to:

- Create a diary entry with a specific date and time, text and category
- See a list of my diary entries and sort them by recency
- See the details of a specific diary entry
- Search for a specific diary entry by date/month/year or category
- Update the text of a diary entry
- Delete a diary entry

**Extensions**
You do not need to do all of those. Choose one or two to implement if time allows:

- The ability to add images to each data entry and attach them to diary entries
- Allow users to find a particular diary entry by searching for a string
- Add an additional feature to the app such as a motivational quote generator or weather generator for the day using an external API
- Add authentification to the app
- Make it pretty!
